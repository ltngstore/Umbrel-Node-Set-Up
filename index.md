1. Set up a Lightning node via Umbrel.

Buy all this shit (Should be under $250):

- Raspberry Pi 4 
- 1 TB SSD
- SSD Enclosure
- 16 GB+ microSD (+ Card reader if your computer doesn't have one)
- Official Raspberry Pi Power Supply
- Ethernet Cable
- Case

2. Put all that shit together!

This is pretty self explanatory, but check out YouTube if you get stuck.

3. Download Umbrel on your computer

4. Download Balena Etcher

5. Plug the microSD card in your computer

6. Flash Umbrel OS

- Flash from file (Unzip and select downloaded Umbrel file)
- Select target (microSD drive)
- FLASH!

7. Insert microSD card in the Pi

8. Connect the SSD

9. Connect to your router.

10. Turn that shit on!

11. After 5-10 minutes, go to http://umbrel.local on any device connected to the same network. If this doesn't work, find IP address with Angry IP scanner and enter that address directly (example http://192.168.1.420)

12. Follow onscreen instructions and wait for Bitcoin core to sync.. This could take up to a week. Once it hits 100%, come back for the next section.
